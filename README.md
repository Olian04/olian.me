Home of my soon(tm) to be (new)portfolio site

![](./design.PNG)

_Note: Design is taken from the ionic doc page._

## What to show

The dark grey menu on the far left should show different tabs: such as, project, work experiance, about me, contact me, etc...
In the project tab (the one shown in the design img) the light gray menu on the left should contain the different categories of projects ive made, as well as an option to search through all of them. Like NPM Packages, Websites, Mobile apps, Desktop apps, etc. Each category should have a table (like in the design) with each row of the table representing a project, and each column representing a certain kind of information, like the name and/or logo of the project, page URL / demo URL, source URL, 1 sentence description, current status, etc.


## Technical info

The page should be written in Vue and should be an offline enabled PWA.
